Let me start by recalling what I know about that term. I remember that City Pop is a genre of music, but I need to make sure I'm accurate.

First, when did City Pop originate? I think it was in Japan during the late 1970s and 1980s. That makes sense because Japan's economy was booming then, leading to a vibrant urban culture. The genre probably blends Western styles like funk, jazz, and disco with Japanese pop elements. Artists like Tatsuro Yamashita and Mariya Takeuchi come to mind. Oh, and there's that song "Plastic Love" by Mariya Takeuchi that went viral online recently, which might have sparked renewed interest.

I should also mention the themes of City Pop songs\u2014they often reflect city life, romance, and leisure, fitting the upbeat and cosmopolitan vibe of the time. The visual style associated with it includes retro anime and vibrant cityscapes, which adds to its aesthetic appeal. It's interesting how the internet, especially platforms like YouTube and Spotify, helped revive this genre internationally. Maybe I should note that connection between modern digital culture and the resurgence of City Pop.

Wait, are there any subgenres or key characteristics I should highlight? The use of synthesizers, smooth vocals, and lush production are typical. Also, City Pop was influenced by yacht rock and soft rock from the West. It's important to link it to Japan's economic bubble era, as that context explains the music's optimistic and luxurious feel.

I need to ensure I don't confuse it with other Japanese genres like J-pop or Enka. City Pop is distinct in its fusion with Western sounds. Including notable albums, like Tatsuro Yamashita's "For You" or Anri's "Timely!!", could be helpful. Oh, and the connection to future funk and vaporwave genres that sample City Pop tracks is a good point for its modern influence.`})}},40363:function(s,e,t){t.r(e),t.d(e,{default:function(){return u}});var a=t(86250),i=t(6874),n=t(85893);function u(){return(0,n.jsxs)(a.Z,{vertical:!0,gap:16,children:[(0,n.jsx)(i.Z,{title:"Task List",defaultOpen:!0,list:[{title:"1\u3001\u641C\u7D22GPT-5\u7684\u5B98\u65B9\u53D1\u5E03\u4FE1\u606F\uFF0C\u786E\u8BA4\u65B0\u7279\u6027",status:"todo"},{title:"2\u3001\u627E\u6280\u672F\u535A\u5BA2\u548C\u884C\u4E1A\u5206\u6790\uFF0C\u83B7\u53D6GPT-5\u8BE6\u7EC6\u6280\u672F\u7279\u6027",status:"todo"},{title:"3\u3001\u4EA4\u53C9\u9A8C\u8BC1\u591A\u4E2A\u6765\u6E90\u4FE1\u606F\uFF0C\u786E\u4FDD\u51C6\u786E\u6027",status:"todo"},{title:"4\u3001\u6574\u7406\u4FE1\u606F\u5E76\u751F\u6210\u7ED3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672C\u62A5\u544A",status:"todo"}]}),(0,n.jsx)(i.Z,{title:"Task List",defaultOpen:!1,list:[{title:"1\u3001\u641C\u7D22GPT-5\u7684\u5B98\u65B9\u53D1\u5E03\u4FE1\u606F\uFF0C\u786E\u8BA4\u65B0\u7279\u6027",status:"done"},{title:"2\u3001\u627E\u6280\u672F\u535A\u5BA2\u548C\u884C\u4E1A\u5206\u6790\uFF0C\u83B7\u53D6GPT-5\u8BE6\u7EC6\u6280\u672F\u7279\u6027",status:"running"},{title:"3\u3001\u4EA4\u53C9\u9A8C\u8BC1\u591A\u4E2A\u6765\u6E90\u4FE1\u606F\uFF0C\u786E\u4FDD\u51C6\u786E\u6027",status:"todo"},{title:"4\u3001\u6574\u7406\u4FE1\u606F\u5E76\u751F\u6210\u7ED3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672C\u62A5\u544A",status:"todo"}]})]})}},99184:function(s,e,t){t.r(e),t.d(e,{default:function(){return n}});var a=t(85786),i=t(85893);function n(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.Z,{title:"Call Tool",subTitle:"I am the name of a tool that is being called",input:{foo:"bar",baz:"qux"},output:{result:"result"}})}},67469:function(s,e,t){t.r(e),t.d(e,{default:function(){return n}});var a=t(69610),i=t(85893);function n(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.Z,{subTitle:"Transformer \u9886\u57DF\u7684\u91CD\u8981\u7814\u7A76",list:[{title:"Transformer\u767B\u4E0Anature\uFF0C\u88AB\u8A89\u4E3A\u5927\u6A21\u578B\u57FA\u77F3\u7684\u5B83\u5230\u5E95\u51ED\u4EC0\u4E48\u8FD9\u4E48\u706B\uFF1F",subTitle:"\u65B0\u6D6A\u65B0\u95FB",link:"https://www.baidu.com",icon:"https://www.baidu.com/favicon.ico"},{title:"Transformer\u767B\u4E0Anature\uFF0C\u5B83\u7684\u6280\u672F\u6838\u5FC3\u662F\u4EC0\u4E48\uFF1F",subTitle:"\u7F51\u6613\u65B0\u95FB",link:"https://www.baidu.com",icon:"https://www.baidu.com/favicon.ico"}]})}}}]);
